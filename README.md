# Test your JavaScript

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a timed coding quiz that subtracts time from the clock if an incorrect response is chosen. Additionally, the assignment called for the user's initials and final score to be saved locally.  

## I practiced the following:

1. HTML DOM traversal
2. JavaScript Timing Events
3. jQuery Selectors and Methods
4. Pushing and pulling data to and from Local Storage 
5. Additional experience with event listeners

## Future Enhancements
1. Insert a pause between "correct"/"incorrect" notification and next question
2. Get user initials from a modal as opposed to an alert box
3. Add color palette and additional styling
